# wooooocommerce

Play a sound everytime someone bought something on your Woocommerce shop, woooooo!

How to use:
Create a webhook in woocommerce and add you consumer key and secret to a file called `keys.json`. Also add your website's url to the file. For example:

Everytime the script run, it fetches the date of the last order. If that date is newer than the previous last date, it must be a new order!

*Note: Currently, the script does not check if the order was actually succesfull. This could be implemented easily by checking the order status field in the json response.*
